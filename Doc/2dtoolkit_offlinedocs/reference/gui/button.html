<h4>The tk2dButon script has been deprecated in favour of the 2D Toolkit UI system. It is a much more comprehensive system supporting a variety of basic controls, and is far more efficient.</h4>

<p>The tk2dButton script is an example of how to create a button using 2D Toolkit. While it is a functional button, but you will probably need to modify this script to fit in to the rest of your project. Check demo 6 - button and 3d sprites for them in action.</p>

<p><img src="img/button.png" alt="Button"></p>

<p>In order to use this script, follow these instructions:
* Create a Sprite and select your initial button sprite.
* Add the tk2dButton behaviour to this Game Object.
* Camera doesn't need to be set if your button is a child of your GUI camera. Otherwise, point it to the camera which will display your button. If you only have one camera in the scene, you may leave this blank.
* Rename "Button Down Sprite" and the others to refect the sprite names you wish to use.</p>

<p><strong>Button Down</strong> - Button is being clicked</p>

<p><strong>Button Up</strong> - Button is no longer being clicked</p>

<p><strong>Button Pressed</strong> - Button has been pressed.</p>

<p>Attach appropriate sounds if you wish, but you will need to attach an AudioSource behaviour if you need it to play sound.</p>

<p><strong>Target Object &amp; Message Name</strong> - the target object to send the message.</p>

<p><strong>Target Scale</strong> - How much the button scales by when the cursor hovers over it</p>

<p><strong>Scale Time</strong> - How long it takes to reach this scale</p>

<p><strong>Pressed Wait Time</strong> - How long it waits before allowing the user to press it again</p>

<p><strong>The button class has had many more improvements under the hood. Check <a href="../../html/classtk2d_button.html">here</a> for more information</strong></p>
