<p>Packed fonts allow you to use the "Pack chars in multiple channels" feature in BMFont. When this is enabled, each channel of your texture (4 channels in a 32 bit image) stores an independent set of glyphs. This means that you can have 4x the number of glyphs in a single texture - a 2048x2048 texture can store the equivalent amount of data as a 4096x4096 texture.</p>

<h2>Set-up</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Export your font from BMFont, ensuring you have <strong>Bit Depth</strong> set to <strong>32</strong>, and <strong>Pack chars in multiple channels</strong> is ticked in "Export Options".</p></li>
<li><p>Set-up this font as you would normally - you can't currently import the font into a sprite collection.</p></li>
<li><p>Switch the shader on the material to tk2d/Goodies/PackedTextMesh.</p></li>
<li><p>Use the font as you would normally, but keep in mind the limitations listed below.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Limitations</h2>

<ul>
<li>Packed fonts are currently not allowed in sprite collections.</li>
<li>You can't change colors on packed fonts, but you can use the gradients feature to achieve similar results. Of course, you'll need a shader to enable this...</li>
<li>Only supported with programmable shaders, and not in fixed function.</li>
<li>The shader overhead is slightly higher than normal shaders.</li>
</ul>
